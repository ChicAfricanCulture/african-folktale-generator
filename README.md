# African Folktale Generator

A digital griot for the 21st century.

This interactive storytelling tool generates culturally specific African folktales rooted in real holidays, cities, and cultures. It is designed to teach, uplift, and correct misconceptions about African life, culture, and storytelling traditions.

## What It Does

This generator builds folktales based on:

- Holidays (e.g. Christmas, Eid al-Fitr, Independence Day)
- Cultures and cities (e.g. Yoruba in Lagos, Akan in Kumasi)
- Themes (Kindness, Community, Wisdom vs. Strength)
- Characters, mythological figures, proverbs, and objects tied to specific cultures

Each story is generated dynamically with a unique setting, character, dilemma, mythological twist, and moral lesson.

## Example Output

During Christmas in Lagos (Yoruba),  
a boy named Adewale carried a beaded calabash through the Marina market,  
seeking to fix a broken promise. He met Oshun, the river goddess, who tested his heart.  
In giving his only food to a stranger, the calabash overflowed with joy.  

**"A kind heart gathers friends like a drum gathers dancers."**
